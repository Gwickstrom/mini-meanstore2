# mini-meanstore2

## Summary

The mini-meanstore is a CodingDojo project that I have adapted with bootstrap to give it some color and a few addons.

## Purpose of the project

Though this repository is unfinished, it is meant to serve as an example of a server/client MEAN structured file. A template that can be modified to fit the users needs.

This project is a tool for the intended purpose of understanding the complex and intricate nature of Front and Backend integration using Mongo Express Angluar and Node (MEAN) using the JavaScript language.

## Notice of Deprecations and potential security issues.

**Some of the applications and methods used in this particular project are now deprecated including Bower.** However, there are methods currently available that translate and convert the bower modules and all of their components to the node_modules folder. This can be done with a few lines of code appended to the ./server.js file, as well as the ./client/index.html

**If you intend to clone this repository, be aware that the project includes the entirety of the node_modules folder.** The modules contained in the folder, though likely safe, may contain harmful pieces of code. This is in part due to their deprecation and acquisition from semi-obscure sources.

## Accreditations  

I built this project using the information and instruction of the professionals of the [CodingDojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/). A great coding Bootcamp I attended in Bellevue, WA.
